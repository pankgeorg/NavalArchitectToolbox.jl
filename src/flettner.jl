# Flettner rotor — 2D potential flow around a rotating cylinder
# (Hess–Smith constant-strength source-panel method + a prescribed bound
# circulation Γ). Pure Julia (LinearAlgebra only); the lightweight sibling
# of the propeller VLM kernel in vlm.jl.
#
# Physics. A spinning cylinder of radius R in a uniform stream V∞ develops a
# bound circulation Γ (Magnus effect). For an *inviscid* rotor the rotation
# only fixes Γ — there is no Kutta point on a smooth cylinder — so we impose
# Γ directly rather than solving a trailing-edge condition. With the surface
# moving at speed ωR, the no-slip-consistent circulation is
#
#     Γ = 2π ω R²            (= surface speed ωR times perimeter 2πR / ... )
#
# i.e. solid-body rotation of the bound vortex. The closed-form surface
# pressure and lift follow from superposing the uniform stream, a doublet
# (the non-lifting cylinder) and a point vortex Γ at the centre:
#
#     V_t(θ)   = 2 V∞ sinθ + Γ/(2πR)
#     Cp(θ)    = 1 − (V_t/V∞)²                       (the analytic reference)
#     C_L      = ½ ∮ −Cp sinθ dθ  =  Γ/(R V∞)  =  4π ω R²/V∞   (with V∞ chord c=2R)
#
# The panel method reproduces these from a discrete no-penetration solve, and
# is the thing we grid-refine to the assignment's ε(C_L) < 0.02 % tolerance.
# At ω=0 it must collapse to the classic non-lifting cylinder Cp = 1 − 4sin²θ.
#
# Sign/orientation convention: panels run COUNTER-CLOCKWISE (θ increasing),
# V∞ along +x. A positive ω gives Γ = 2πωR² > 0 and **positive lift** in the
# convention C_L = ½∮ −Cp sinθ dθ (matching the analytic C_L = +4πωR²/V∞).
# Because the CCW panel ordering makes the source-resolved freestream
# surface-tangential run opposite to the analytic `Vt = 2V∞ sinθ + Γ/(2πR)`
# convention, the central point vortex is taken with the matching sign so its
# velocity reinforces the flow over the *top* of the cylinder (the lift-
# producing side); see the in-code note. Verified against `flettner_analytic`.

    flettner_panel(; R=0.5, ω=1.0, V∞=1.0, N=200) -> (; θ, Cp, CL, Γ)

2D Hess–Smith potential-flow solve for a rotating cylinder of radius `R`
in a uniform stream `V∞` (along +x), with a prescribed bound circulation
`Γ = 2π ω R²` (the Magnus circulation of a smooth spinning cylinder — no
Kutta condition, the rotation sets Γ directly).

The cylinder is discretized into `N` constant-strength **source** panels
arranged counter-clockwise; per-panel source strengths `σ` enforce
no-penetration at the panel control points, with the freestream **and**
the prescribed point-vortex `Γ` (placed at the centre) on the right-hand
side. Surface pressure is recovered from the tangential velocity at each
control point, `Cp = 1 − (V_t/V∞)²`, and the lift from
`CL = ½∮ −Cp sinθ dθ` over chord `c = 2R`.

Returns the control-point angles `θ` (radians, CCW), `Cp(θ)`, the lift
coefficient `CL`, and the imposed circulation `Γ`. Validate against
[`flettner_analytic`](@ref): at `ω = 0` this is the non-lifting cylinder
`Cp = 1 − 4sin²θ`; grid-refine `N` to drive `ε(CL) < 0.02 %`.
